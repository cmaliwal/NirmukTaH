### NIRMUKTAH - Free From . . . . 

This repository is a first of its kind implementation of a TCR Implementation for the journalism model. This project was developed during the ETH India Hackathon held on 10-12 Aug'18.

### Introduction

This project is aimed to provide a decentralized solution to having interpretations of the News Articles via the collaborative effect of the community.

Token Curated Registries, which powers [AdChain](published.adchain.com) and developed by [Mike Goldin](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels), also is the **Heart** of this project.

This project implements a slightly differnent version of the TCR, mainly TCR 2.0, where people are empowered to decide not only on 2 things (**For** or **Against**), but enables them to add their own illustrations and interpretations.

### Insights of the Project

Currently, the project contains the power to host 2 interpretations for one article which is up for voting. The illustrations being stored on IPFS, with their Hash associated with the Article's link itself on Ethereum Chain.

Current inner workings include the Smart Contracts, IPFS Codebase to allow storing documents on the network.

### Workings of the Project:

1. PLCRVoting.sol is used to handle the Partial-Lock-Commit-Reveal Voting Mechanism.

1. Parameterizer.sol is used to govern the TCR Parameters and allow them to change as per the proposals.

1. Registry.sol is used as the Heart of the Project, which allows anyone to post a new article with their own interpretation, or provide a different interpretation on an already existing article up for voting.

### Tools and Technology used by Us

1. **Solidity**: Smart contract development

1. **Truffle**: For development Enviroment

1. **BitBucket / GitHub**: As a Version Control System

1. **Remix** : As a Code Editor

1. **Metamask** and **TestRPC**

1. **IPFS** : Used to store the interpretations by individual

1. **Web3.js**

1. **Bootstrap** : FrontEnd Design

1. **ERC20** Tokens

1. **NodeJS** for Backend API

We (Team0dot0) belive that blockchain has an potential that can change course of human development.
